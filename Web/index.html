				<h2>Romeo and Juliet</h2>
				<h4>ACT 1</h4>
				<h4>PROLOGUE</h4>
				<p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
				In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
				From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
				Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
				From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
				A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
				Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
				Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
				The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
				And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
				Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
				Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
				The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
				What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
				<h4>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h4>
				<i>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</i>
				<h4>SAMPSON</h4>
				<p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
				<h4>GREGORY</h4>
				<p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
